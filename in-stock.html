            <li>Wild hyacinth: This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows best in well-drained soil
                high in humus. It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open
                meadows or prairies. Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be
                divided in autumn after the leaves have withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. Additionally
                the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.</li>
